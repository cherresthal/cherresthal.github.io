  <h3>Hidden Testing and Selective Disclosure of Evidence
    (<a href="CHerresthal_HiddenTesting.pdf">pdf</a>)
 
  </h3>
 <p><i><b>Revise and Resubmit at Journal of Economic Theory </b></i>

  <p>
    An agent can sequentially run informative tests about an unknown state and disclose (some or all) outcomes to a decision maker
    who then faces an approval choice. Players agree on the optimal choice under certainty, but the decision maker has a higher
    approval threshold than the agent. I compare the case where testing is hidden and the agent chooses which test outcomes to
    verifiably disclose to the case where testing is observable. When testing is observable, I show that the agent may
    strategically stop testing even if further tests could yield a mutual benefit. 
    I find conditions under which the decision maker is strictly better off under hidden testing 
    and in some equilibria both players are strictly better off under hidden testing than in the unique equilibrium
    under observable testing.

  <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Performance-Based Rankings and School Quality (<a href="CHerresthal_Ranking_190603.pdf">pdf</a>)
  </h3>
  <p><i><b>The Economic Journal, Volume 130, Issue 630, August 2020, Pages 1729–1752</b></i>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I study students' inferences about school quality from performance-based
  rankings in a dynamic setting. Schools differ in location and unobserved
  quality, students differ in location and ability. Short-lived students observe
  a school ranking as a signal about schools' relative quality, but this signal
  also depends on the ability of schools' past intakes. Students apply to
  schools, trading off expected quality against proximity. Oversubscribed schools
  select applicants based on an admission rule. In steady-state equilibrium, I
  find that rankings are more informative if oversubscribed schools select more
  able applicants or if students care less about distance to school.
