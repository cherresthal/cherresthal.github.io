  <h3>Hidden Testing and Selective Disclosure of Evidence

  </h3>


  <p>
    I consider a game with two players, a decision maker and an advisor,
    who are uncertain about the state of the world. The advisor can sequentially run
    informative tests and disclose (some or all) of the outcomes to the decision maker.
    The decision maker then faces a binary choice. Players agree on the optimal choice
    under certainty, but their preferences are misaligned under uncertainty in that
    players differ in how they trade off losses from wrong choices. I characterize
    equilibria of this game. In particular, I compare the case where testing is hidden 
    and the advisor can choose which test outcomes to verifiably disclose to the case where
    testing is observable. I show that the decision maker is weakly better off when testing 
    is hidden rather than observable if players' preferences are sufficiently misaligned.
    Otherwise, hidden testing can leave the decision maker strictly worse off. 
    I identify conditions on preference parameters under which both players can be strictly 
    better off when testing is hidden rather than observable.

  I study students' inferences about school quality from performance-based
  rankings in a dynamic setting. Schools differ in location and unobserved
  quality, students differ in location and ability. Short-lived students observe
  a school ranking as a signal about schools' relative quality, but this signal
  also depends on the ability of schools' past intakes. Students apply to
  schools, trading off expected quality against proximity. Oversubscribed schools
  select applicants based on an admission rule. In steady-state equilibrium, I
  find that rankings are more informative if oversubscribed schools select more
  able applicants or if students care less about distance to school.
