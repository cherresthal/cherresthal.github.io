<h3>Performance-Based Rankings and School Quality (pdf)</h3>
<b>R&R at The Economic Journal</b>
<p>
I study students' inferences about school quality from performance-based
rankings in a dynamic setting. Schools differ in location and unobserved
quality, students differ in location and ability. Short-lived students observe
a school ranking as a signal about schools' relative quality, but this signal
also depends on the ability of schools' past intakes. Students apply to
schools, trading off expected quality against proximity. Oversubscribed schools
select applicants based on an admission rule. In steady-state equilibrium, I
find that rankings are more informative if oversubscribed schools select more
able applicants or if students care less about distance to school.

<h3>Hidden Testing and Selective Disclosure of Evidence (pdf)</h3>
<p>
This paper contrasts a decision maker’s payoff under public and private
information acquisition by a biased advisor. Both players agree on the
optimal choice under certainty, but differ in how they trade off the loss
from errors. The advisor can sequentially acquire informative test outcomes.
If acquisition is private he decides in the final period which realizations
to verifiably disclose. If players’ preferences are sufficiently misaligned,
the decision maker is weakly better off under private rather than public
information acquisition. The effect on the advisor’s payoff depends on the
direction of his bias.
