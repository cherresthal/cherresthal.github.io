  <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Performance-Based Rankings and School Quality (<a href="Herresthal_rankings_final.pdf">pdf</a>)</h3>
  <p><b>R&R at The Economic Journal</b></p>
  <p>
  I study students' inferences about school quality from performance-based
  rankings in a dynamic setting. Schools differ in location and unobserved
  quality, students differ in location and ability. Short-lived students observe
  a school ranking as a signal about schools' relative quality, but this signal
  also depends on the ability of schools' past intakes. Students apply to
  schools, trading off expected quality against proximity. Oversubscribed schools
  select applicants based on an admission rule. In steady-state equilibrium, I
  find that rankings are more informative if oversubscribed schools select more
  able applicants or if students care less about distance to school.

  <h3>Hidden Testing and Selective Disclosure of Evidence
  (<a href="HiddenTestingSelectiveDisclosure_CHerresthal_171211.pdf">pdf</a>)</h3>
  <p>
  This paper contrasts a decision maker’s payoff under public and private
  information acquisition by a biased advisor. Both players agree on the
  optimal choice under certainty, but differ in how they trade off the loss
  from errors. The advisor can sequentially acquire informative test outcomes.
  If acquisition is private he decides in the final period which realizations
  to verifiably disclose. If players’ preferences are sufficiently misaligned,
  the decision maker is weakly better off under private rather than public
  information acquisition. The effect on the advisor’s payoff depends on the
  direction of his bias.
